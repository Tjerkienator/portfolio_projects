# Cleaning and Preparing Data for Data Exploration and Visualization

One of the key responsibilities is to extract insights from raw data through data exploration and visualization. However, before we can conduct any analysis or generate visualizations, it is critical to ensure that the data is clean, consistent, and formatted in a way that is suitable for analysis.

The objective of this project is to clean and prepare the data for analysis and visualization. This will involve identifying and addressing data quality issues, ensuring data consistency, and transforming data into a suitable format for analysis.
