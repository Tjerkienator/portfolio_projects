# Cleaning and Preparing Data for Data Exploration and Visualization

One of the key responsibilities is to extract insights from raw data through data exploration and visualization. However, before we can conduct any analysis or generate visualizations, it is critical to ensure that the data is clean, consistent, and formatted in a way that is suitable for analysis.

The objective of this project is to clean and prepare the data for analysis and visualization. This will involve identifying and addressing data quality issues, ensuring data consistency, and transforming data into a suitable format for analysis.

To ensure clarity and transparency, I have included comments throughout the file to explain my thought process and the steps I am taking to clean the data. The comments will make it easier for anyone who reviews the file to understand what I am doing and why.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns about the SQL file. I am happy to provide additional context or clarify any details as needed.

Thank you for your time and attention.

Best regards,
Douwe Tjerkstra
