# Data Exploration in SQL

This project involves data exploration and analysis using SQL. My goal is to explore a the previously created dataset and gain insights into the data using SQL queries.

The previous phase of the project was about importing the dataset into a SQL database and organizing it in a logical and intuitive manner. Now that the data is properly formatted, I will begin exploring the data using SQL queries.

I will focus on identifying patterns, trends, and outliers in the data using various SQL commands such as SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, and JOIN. The project will involve both basic and advanced SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the dataset.

The project will require proficiency in SQL, data manipulation, and data analysis. I will use best practices for data exploration and follow standard protocols for data handling and storage.

The resulting insights and findings from this project will provide valuable information to inform decision-making and future data analysis efforts.

If you have any questions or require further details, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thank you in advance.

Best regards,

Douwe Tjerkstra.
