# Data Visualization in Tableau

This project involves data visualization using Tableau. My objective is to create visually appealing and informative dashboards that effectively communicate insights from a given dataset.

The initial phase of the project will involve importing the dataset into Tableau and organizing it in a logical and intuitive manner. Once the data is properly formatted, I will begin creating visualizations using various chart types such as bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, heat maps, and others.

I will focus on creating interactive dashboards that allow users to explore the data and identify patterns and trends. The dashboards will be designed to provide valuable insights into the data and communicate complex information in a simple and concise manner.

The project will require proficiency in Tableau, data visualization, and design principles. I will use best practices for data visualization and follow standard protocols for data handling and storage.

The resulting dashboards from this project will provide valuable information about the relation between the sentiment of tweets and the engagement created from that tweet.

If you have any questions or require further details, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thank you in advance.

Best regards,
Douwe Tjerkstra.
