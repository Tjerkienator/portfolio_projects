# Web Scraping and Sentiment Analysis of Elon Musk Tweets

This project involved web scraping and sentiment analysis of tweets made by Elon Musk. Using the Twitter API, over 400 of his latest tweets were extracted and exported into a CSV file. This file contains publicly available data from his tweets, such as their text content, date posted, number of likes/retweets, and other relevant information.

In addition to the raw tweet data, sentiment analysis was performed on each tweet using OpenAI's Natural Language Processing (NLP) platform. This allowed for an overall assessment of the sentiment or 'mood' of each tweet, ranging from positive to negative. The resulting sentiment analysis was recorded in a separate CSV file for reference.

The project required proficiency in Python programming language and its ecosystem, along with a strong understanding of data collection and file organization. Through this project, I have demonstrated our ability to effectively collect and analyze social media data using modern data analysis techniques.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns about this scraping project. I am happy to provide additional context or clarify any details as needed.

Thank you in advance.

Best regards,
