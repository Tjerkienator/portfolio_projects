# Data Scraping with Python

Part one of this project is a web scraping and sentiment analysis of tweets made by Elon Musk. I used the Twitter API to scrape over 400 of his latest tweets, which were exported in a csv file. This csv file contain all publicly available data from his tweets, including their text content, date posted, number of likes/retweets, and more.

In addition to extracting raw tweet data, I also performed sentiment analysis on each tweet using OpenAI's Natural Language Processing (NLP) platform. This allowed me to determine the overall sentiment or 'mood' of each tweet, ranging from positive to negative. The results of this analysis were included in a second CSV file.

This is an example of my understanding and application of the Python programming language and its ecosystem. In addition to being proficient in coding, I also understand the importance of data collection and file organization.

I am proud that this project has allowed me to demonstrate my Python programming skills and add another item to my portfolio!
