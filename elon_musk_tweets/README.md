# Sentiment Analysis of Elon Musk's Tweets

I am pleased to introduce my portfolio project, which showcases my skills in data analysis by conducting a comprehensive analysis of Elon Musk's tweets. As a data analyst, I utilized a structured approach consisting of four smaller projects to conduct this analysis.

The first project involved data scraping using Python, where I scraped data from Twitter's API to capture relevant information on Musk's tweets, including date and time posted, retweets, and likes. In the second project, I utilized SQL to clean and transform the scraped data, ensuring its consistency and eliminating any duplicates or errors.

Next, I applied data exploration techniques using SQL to identify correlations, patterns, and trends in the data, thus extracting key insights, such as the most frequent topics discussed by Musk, the time of day when he is most active, and the sentiment of his tweets over time.

Finally, I leveraged Tableau Public to create interactive data visualizations that effectively communicated my findings to stakeholders. By presenting my insights through data dashboards, I made it easier for decision-makers to comprehend the data, which could aid in making informed decisions.

Through this project, I demonstrated my ability to translate raw data into actionable insights that could inform business decisions. I would be thrilled to apply my skills and knowledge to similar tasks in your organization. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Douwe Tjerkstra
