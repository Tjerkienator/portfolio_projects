# Data Analysis Project Portfolio

I am pleased to introduce my Github repository that showcases my portfolio projects as a data analyst. Throughout my career, I have gained experience in several programming languages, tools, and techniques that have enabled me to analyze complex data sets effectively. 

In my portfolio projects, I used Python, SQL, and Tableau to conduct comprehensive data analyses and generate insights that could inform business decisions.

One example of my work is a sentiment analysis project of Elon Musk's tweets. In this project, I scraped data from Twitter's API and used SQL to clean and transform the data to ensure its consistency. 

Then, I conducted exploratory data analysis to identify patterns, correlations, and trends in the data. I used Tableau to visualize my findings, which included sentiment analysis of Musk's tweets over time. Through this project, I demonstrated my ability to translate raw data into meaningful insights that could inform business decisions.

My Github repository is organized in folders, with each folder containing a distinct project. Within each project, I have structured the smaller projects to showcase my data analyst skills effectively. 

Through my portfolio projects, I have demonstrated my ability to handle complex data sets, clean and transform data, identify patterns and correlations, and communicate insights effectively through data visualizations.

I believe that my skills and expertise in data analysis could be an asset to your organization, and I would be thrilled to discuss how I could contribute to your team. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Douwe Tjerkstra
